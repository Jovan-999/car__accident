          WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO CONTACT AN<br />
          ATTORNEY AFTER YOUR CAR ACCIDENT</h1>
         <div class=" text-start">
          <p>After an accident, some people hesitate to contact a Massachusetts personal injury attorney, believing they
            can handle the situation on their own. It’s true that you aren’t legally obligated to contact a Massachusetts
            personal injury lawyer, but doing so is in your best interests. 
            </p>

                Fault is not always easy to determine in a car accident. Even when it seems clear, you still need the proper evidence to prove it. Our team will collect physical evidence, hire investigators and retain expert witnesses, take photos of the scene, obtain a copy of the accident report from the police, and speak to witnesses. 

  
                <p class="h5 text-white mt-3">Determining fault can make a big difference in the amount of compensation that you receive in a settlement offer. What’s more, this step is necessary, because you may not receive any compensation at all if negligence can’t be proven.</p>

              Reporting an injury claim to the insurance company (even your own) can be a complex process. You may not know how to file a claim, or whom to file against, or to what benefits you are entitled. 

              <p class="h5 text-white mt-3">Sometimes claims may need to be filed with more than one party. For example, if a defective part was involved in the accident, there may be manufacturing companies involved. As your Massachusetts car accident lawyers, we can determine what parties are involved and file all necessary legal claims on your behalf.</p>

              <p>It might be tempting to take the first settlement 
                amount offered to you after your accident,

                <p>
             Insurance companies know that after an accident
             you’re overwhelmed with stress and financial loss, 
             and they often take advantage of this situation
             by offering a low payout. They know that you may
             be relieved to receive any sort of compensation at all.
             Once you accept a payout, there’s no turning back.
             You could miss out on thousands of dollars.

             Our Massachusetts car accident attorneys at Jason Stone
             Injury Lawyers have been reviewing settlement offers
             from insurance companies for over 20 years and are able
             to advise you whether an offer is a good one. If it isn’t,
             or if it doesn’t include everything that should be included,
             then we will continue to aggressively
             negotiate with the insurance company until we get you more money. 
             It’s important to us that you receive an amount that
             compensates you for all of the difficulties that
             you have had since the crash which wasn’t your fault.

              No one wants to sue, but sometimes you have to.
              Usually, injuries caused by car accidents
              can be settled out of court. However,
              we have learned that the best way to ensure
              a settlement we can be proud of is to prepare
              for trial from the very beginning.
              When the insurance company extends
              a low settlement offer, it is a good 
              practice to be ready to file a lawsuit
              and hold their feet to the fire if
              they don’t meet our demands.
